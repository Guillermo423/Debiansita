  abstract = {This paper presents the basic concepts and the module structure of the Distributed and Unified Numerics
              Environment and reflects on recent developments and general changes that happened since the release of the
              first Dune version in 2007 and the main papers describing that state Bastian etal. (2008a, 2008b). This
              discussion is accompanied with a description of various advanced features, such as coupling of domains and
              cut cells, grid modifications such as adaptation and moving domains, high order discretizations and node
              level performance, non-smooth multigrid methods, and multiscale methods. A brief discussion on current and
              future development directions of the framework concludes the paper.},
